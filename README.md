# Object-Oriented Programming Practice

* Understanding state (constructors, properties / attributes etc...)
* Understanding basic iteration / accumulator concepts
* Understanding basic object / array / variable concepts

## Setup

Make sure you have node 0.12 or greater, and you have `broccoli-timepiece`:

```
npm install -g broccoli
npm install -g broccoli-timepiece
npm install
```

If you don't have node 0.12 try:

```
brew update && brew upgrade node
```

## Running the files

For ruby, cd into the directory and run `rspec` from the directory.

From the root directory run:

```
npm run serve
```

Then cd into the directory you want to practice. To run tests:

```
jasmine spec/the_exercise_spec.js
```

## Exercises

### Easy

* Robots
* Cars

### Medium

* Playlist
* Toll Road

### A little harder

* Parking lot (on account of having to fill in empty spaces)
* Filesystem (on account of the symlink)
* DMV (on account of the need to track two sets of data)
